# Retail Analytics dbt Project

This repository contains a dbt-based analytics engineering project that transforms raw retail data into analytics-ready tables for reporting, dashboards, and advanced analysis such as customer cohorts and retention.

The project follows dbt best practices with clear layer separation, testing, documentation, and reusable macros.

##  Project Architecture

The project is organized into the following layers:
```
sources  →  staging  →  intermediate  →  marts
                         ↓
                      snapshots
                         ↓
                       tests
```					   

```

```
Each layer has a clearly defined responsibility to ensure data quality, scalability, and maintainability.


## 🗂️ Data Sources (sources)

The sources layer defines the system-of-record tables ingested from the production database (public schema).

### Source Tables
- orders – Customer orders and order status
- order_items – Line-item details for each order
- products – Product attributes and pricing
- categories – Product categories
- departments – Department hierarchy
- customers – Customer profile and address data

## Staging Layer (stg_)

The staging layer performs light transformations and standardization:
- Renames columns into analytics-friendly formats
- Applies basic data cleaning
- Preserves one-to-one row mapping with source tables

### Staging Models
- stg_retail__orders
- stg_retail__order_items
- stg_retail__products
- stg_retail__categories
- stg_retail__departments
- stg_retail__customers

## Intermediate Layer (int_)

The intermediate layer applies business logic and enrichment to prepare data for analytics use cases.

### Intermediate Models
- int_retail__orders – Orders enriched with timestamps and calendar attributes
- int_retail__order_items – Order-item grain with revenue calculations
- int_retail__customers – Cleaned customer dimension
- int_retail__products – Product attributes
- int_retail__categories – Category-to-department mapping
- int_retail__departments – Department dimension
- int_fact_sales – Core fact table at order-item grain
- int_dim_product – Denormalized product dimension


## Mart Layer (marts)

The mart layer provides analytics- and BI-ready tables optimized for reporting and decision-making.

### Mart Models
- dim_customers – Customer dimension for segmentation, LTV, and cohorts
- top_products – Product revenue rankings
- sales_metrics – Daily sales KPIs with rolling metrics
- customer_order_count – Customer behavior by order status
- customer_cohorts – Cohort and retention analysis by month

## Snapshots (snapshots)

Snapshots track historical changes over time.

**Snapshot**: snapshot_sales_metrics
- Tracks changes to the sales_metrics model
- Uses a timestamp-based strategy
- Enables historical trend and audit analysis

## Macros (macros)

Reusable SQL logic is centralized in macros.

Macro: initcap_and_coalesce
- Applies INITCAP formatting
- Replaces NULL values with a default
- Ensures consistent text formatting across models

## Tests (tests)

Custom and built-in dbt tests ensure data quality and trust.

Example Custom Test
- Validates that: quantity × product_price = subtotal
- Catches calculation and ingestion errors early

Other tests include:
- Primary key uniqueness
- Not-null constraints
- Referential integrity
- Accepted value validation
